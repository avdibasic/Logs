Use the command `nmap -sS -p- <target_ip>` to perform a full port scan. This is necessary to identify all open ports and potential services running on the target machine.\n\n1. **Identify Open Ports and Services using Nmap:**\n    - **Step 1:** Open a terminal on your testing machine.\n    - **Step 2:** Ensure you have Nmap installed. If not, install it using the appropriate package manager for your OS (e.g., `sudo apt-get install nmap` for Debian-based systems).\n    - **Step 3:** Identify the target IP address you need to scan.\n    - **Step 4:** Execute the command `nmap -sS -p- <target_ip>`, replacing `<target_ip>` with the actual IP address of the target.\n    - **Step 5:** Wait for the scan to complete and review the results to list all open ports and services."]]}
